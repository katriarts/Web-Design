<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)">
	Ever wonder what is it like to have an extended family? or what is it like to be reunitedd with your family and other relatives in every special occassions?<br>
	Well, in all honesty, it is quite chaotic... but is really FUN!<br>
	The truth is, being the eldest chid in my part of nuclear family is very quiet. And I like it... A lot. <br>
	Not a lot of children to take care of for my two younger brothers are quite reliable, even if we fight some times, because I think that it's normal for siblings to fight...
	Because no matter what happens, we still have to be there... Alongside one another... Amazing, Right?<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)">
	Back when I was still a kid, every holidays, we would go visit our province, and it was such an exciting feeling for me to always meet my cousins and friends at our province.<br>
	Playing with them under the sun, not caring about being scolded by our parents or other elderlies, I was such a reckless and sleepless child back then... <br>
	and I must say, I have enjoyed my childhood...
</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)">
	But as to what I have noticed, as I grew older, my cousins and friends grew apart, becoming too busy.<br>
	Even I don't socialize that much anymore, although, I'm not really a sociable person, they were usually the ones who initiate a friendship or a greeting.<br>
	It's not that I can't find time to see them, I'm just too busy focusing on my studies. One thing about me that my family had noticed is that I like studying, and yes, I do.<br>
	I like studying, because it makes my mind busy, in times of boredom or overthinking (because of panic attacks). But not because I like to  study doesn't mean that I am very intellectual.<br>
	I'm heck a procrastinator too. It's quite hard to explain, but... when I feel lazy, I would finish all my requirements so I can finally procrastinate. I'm not that smart.	
	<br>
	<br>
	Wished I could go to our province again. I'd love to meet the kids (the millennial ones), I kind of like children, but npot into taking care of them because I'm a childish bum.

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)">
	My Junior High School years have been splendid for an introverted person like me, it's because my friends are also introverts.<br>
	I didn't even remember how we've became the best of friends. I just know that we've got quite a lot in common.<br>
	It doesn't get awkward when we're walking and not even talking with one another.<br>

	Even though we've went in our separate ways now that we are in college, we still try to contact each other, and chatting them how are they.<br>
	I do miss them, and I wish them success, and maybe one day, we'll all get together, and have some bonding time, like we used to do.

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)"> 
	Senior High School, my first time in the University of the Cordilleras... being a lone wolf.<br>
	Then, suddenly, people approaching me, making new friends... I feeel like my introverted self is becoming social...<br>
	but still... a socially-awkward little dumpling am I.
</p>

<p><img src="mmm.jpg" alt="life2" width="300" height="200" class="centerimage"></p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)"> 
	It's weird but, the truth is, I feel quite uncomfortable. I started to realize that my social interaction is improving. <br>
	I got to consider myself and even declared to myself that I am an ambivert.

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)"> 
	But it's just what I thought. I know that I have these kind of classmates who tries to talk to me or walk with me or even asking me out or joining on their hangouts and such... <br>
	But I got so anxious, panic attacks and sensitiveness, I hate it. I'm not an emo or anything, I'm just too self-conscious... <br>
	I can't even tell it to anyone... The feelings... It just... comes and go... That's why I never told anyone...<br>
	I remained silent... Hiding... Smiling... and trying to have fun... I'm trying...

<p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;text-align:center;color:brown;background-color:rgb(204, 255, 204, 0.5)"> 
	I consider the people who tells me the truth face-to-face about what they don't like about me as mannered people.<br>
	Expecially when they make me cry... I know it is weird, but they were so truthful that I want to be friends with them... <br>
	Even if I have a sensitive soul.
